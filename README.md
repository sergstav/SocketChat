# SocketChat
C++ chat based on network

This chat supports only one-to-one communication.

To start chatting you need to start ./Debug/chat_server_oop_v0.1.exe then start ./Debug/chat_client_oop_v0.1.exe, in client window type ip of server, e.g. 127.0.0.1, in server window you'll see a 'User online' message. 

If you have MS Visual Studio then you can open this project for editing. To do this you need to open chat_server_opp_v01 in the root directory. Then you'll see project that consist of two subprojects (client and server).

Have fun!
